### Cloud computing
**Cloud Computing** - On-demand delivery of compute, database, storage applications and other IT resources.
Think of it like renting a computer.

**Avantages:**

	1) Pay a variable expense instead of static. In other words **Pay for what you use**
	2) Benefit from massive economies of scale
		Amazon has the ability to produce massive computing power
	3) Stop guessing about capacity.
		Standard approaches, you may over purchase computing power or under purchase. With Cloud computing you can automatically scale
	4) Increase speed & Agility - 'serverless computing', increase speed e.g ram as needed
	5) No need to manage/maintaining data centers. Stop managing infrastructure
	6) Go global in minutes - Deploy your application everywhere very quickly

**Types Of Cloud Computing:**

### IAAS
### Infrastructure As A Service
	1) IAAS - Infrastructure As A Service
		Database, storage - Physical or vertual, the provider usually has no access to your server.
### PAAS
### Platform As A Service
	2) PAAS - Platform As A Service
		Hardware & Operating system. Soemone else worried about security, patching, updates etc
### SAAS
### Software As A Service
	3) Software As A Service (SAAS)
		Software. Example is GMAIL
		
### CDN
**CDN**
	Amazon's Content delivery Network
	
### TAM
**TAM***
	Technical Account Manager available to Enterprise users
	
	
Types of Cloud Computing Deployments:
	
	1) Public Cloud
		AWS, Azure, GCP
	2) Hybrid
		Mixture of public and private - E.g public website but employee data is private
	3) Private cloud (Or On Premise)
		You manage it in your datacenter openstack or VMware.
	

AWS Global Infrastructure
-------------------------
Availability Zone - Datacenter or several data centres close together
Region - Geographical area consisting of 2 or more Availability Zones
Edge Location - caching location  E.G CDN, CloudFront etc
















How to choose a Region / choosing the right region / Why choose particular
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Data sovereignty Laws** - E.G data can only reside in a particular country
**Latency to end users** - Where the customers are located
**AWS Services** - Amazon may have more services in particular regions
